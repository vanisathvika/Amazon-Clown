# Amazon.in Clown Project

This project recreates a playful version of the Amazon.in homepage with a humorous, "clown" theme. The project uses basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the page, including elements like header, product listings, and footer with humorous or exaggerated Amazon-themed content.
- **style.css**: Provides styling to give the page a unique "clown" look. Includes bright colors, unusual fonts, and other stylistic choices to enhance the theme.

## Features

- **Playful Design**: Uses bright and quirky styling to give the appearance of a clown-themed Amazon homepage.
- **Simple Layout**: The project keeps the layout minimal and focuses on the humorous aspect of styling and content placement.
- **Responsive Elements**: Ensures that major elements adapt to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
